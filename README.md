## 📈 Data Integration

### Population-Based Sales Model

  - Erongo (Coastal): 1.3x multiplier
  - Northern regions: 0.8-0.9x multiplier
  - Rural areas: 0.7-0.8x multiplier

### Sales Calculation Formula
```
Regional Revenue = Population × Base Revenue per Capita × Economic Multiplier
Customer Base = 50% of regional population (market penetration)
```
